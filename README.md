### a new world

A combination of some of my favorite games growing up. Harvest Moon, Animal
Crossing, Runescape, Factorio, to name a few..


#### Known Issues

This is a list of tech issues that I know I need to fix eventually, but it's
not worth it now in the prototyping stage:
- the client rendering of player sprites doesn't remove sprites on the map that
  no longer exist on the server side of things - this needs to be fixed
  eventually. for now a simple page refresh will do the trick :)
